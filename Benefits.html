<h1 class="b">Benefits of Having a Website</h1>
<div class="benefits">
 
<div class="bdiv">
  <h2 class="h2">1. Save Money </h2>
  <p class="pb">	Cut out most of the cost when 
      it comes to flyers, brochures, and other 
      paper advertisements with an online presence. 
      This way you will be advertising yourself 
      (portfolio website) and/or your 
      business, while saving money. </p>
</div> 
<div  class="bdiv">
  <h2 class="h2" > 2.Professionalism </h2>
  <p class="pb">Owning a website with your name not only
       solidify your business recognition, but 
       credibility as well. It shows that you are 
       serious and open for business. Making it
        easier for you to be found if a potential 
        customer were to lose your 
      business card or flyer. </p>
  </div>
<div  class="bdiv">
  <h2 class="h2">3.	Display Talent</h2>
  <p class="pb">	Having a portfolio builds 
      trust and confidence. This way one can add
       testimonials and awards. Positive reviews and 
       customer experience plays a huge role in 
       attracting new clients 
      and prospects. </p>
    </div>
    <div  class="bdiv">
  <h2 class="h2">4.	Easy Access to Data</h2>
  <p class="pb">	For the customer, it makes it
       easier for them to find out what your 
       services are beforehand. Having an FAQ
        section where they can easily find answers
         to everyday questions take the strain of
          both parties, allowing customers to 
          obtain answers before even arriving to business location. As 
          the owner it gives you the opportunity
           to review data on site visits and be
            more informed on type
       of clientele. </p>
    </div>
    <div  class="bdiv">

  <h2 class="h2">5.	Ecommerce </h2>
  <p class="pb">	Selling products has become
       less of a hassle and easier to hold on to 
       profit. Instead of having an ordinary 
       business location and having to pay for it;
        have an ecommerce store. This cuts the 
        expense of needing a space and allows you 
        to sell and ship 
      all online. </p> </div>
